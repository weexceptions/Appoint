       <p style="font-size: medium">If you’re not taking full advantage of the nutritional and medicinal properties of honey, it’s time to begin doing so because honey is a remarkable healing agent for all sorts of ailments.<br>
People have been using honey for its antibacterial and antifungal properties since the ancient times.
In fact, the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians documented the healing properties of honey as early as Aristotle’s mention of it in 384 BC.<br>
Honey is certainly an old product that has won over the hearts of many in the natural healing niche.<br>
Honey is the way to go not just to replace sugar, but to add nutrition and wellness to your life.<br>
At its basic makeup, one tablespoon of honey is about 64 calories and has no fat or cholesterol.<br><br>
It includes vitamins, trace enzymes, amino acids, and minerals like calcium, iron, sodium chlorine, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium.
Because of its bend toward the acidic PH level (3.2 to 4.5), it helps reduce bacteria growth and the antioxidant properties help it wipe out some free radicals.
It is perhaps one of the best sweeteners on the planet and we all know that we could use less processed sugar!

Helps with Allergies
<br><br>
 
Because of honey’s anti-inflammatory properties, it is able to help reduce allergy symptoms.<br>
It acts as a natural vaccine because it contains little amounts of pollen.<br>
Do you suffer with a runny nose and itchy eyes when allergy season hits?<br>
Are you constantly popping Benadryl or using Nasonex nasal spray?<br>
If so, honey will do you a world of good.<br>
Once your body gets a small taste of the honey’s pollen, it will produce antibodies that will take care of that pollen, which means that your body will build up a defense against that allergy, over time.<br>
It’s like your immune system gets a tiny hint of that pollen you’re allergic to and goes into attack mode.<br>
Because it’s just a little bit of pollen, your immune system successfully attacks and kills it, building up immunity to it at the same time.<br>
Pretty amazing, huh?<br>
It is important to ingest honey that is from your local region as this is the honey that will contain pollen spores from the local flowers.<br>
By taking a little bit of honey daily (a teaspoon is recommended), your body will build up a natural immunity to the allergens that would normally make you crazy with allergy symptoms.<br>
Keep in mind that you should begin taking honey two to three months before allergy season to give your body time to build that immunity.<br>
To obtain local honey, hit the farmers market, a co-op, or a natural health food store near you.<br><br>
Energy Booster<br>
 
Ever feel like lying your head down on your desk at work after lunch because you’re feeling completely zapped?<br>
How about trouble getting moving in the morning?<br>
Yes, our energy can surely fluctuate, so anytime we can utilize a natural energy booster, it’s certainly a win-win.
<br>Because of its high carbohydrate load, honey is a wonderful source of unprocessed sugar energy.<br>
The glucose and fructose hit the bloodstream quickly, which gives you the boost you need to get moving.<br>
It’s a great way to start off a long exercise regimen.<br>
Otherwise, include it with your breakfast every morning to give you the boost you need.<br>
A great idea is to add a spoonful to a cup of hot tea, as well as cutting back on your coffee consumption; too much coffee does not really give you an energy boost.<br>
You can also make some iced tea for the afternoon and sweeten it with a tablespoon of honey.<br>
Heck, you might as well just carry a little jar with you to have on hand.<br>
Just take one to two tablespoons of raw honey per day and keep it moving.<br>
 
As we age, we want to keep our memory sharp, so consuming foods that will give the memory a boost is recommended.<br>
Antioxidants are fabulous for feeding the cells of your brain the food it needs to thrive.<br>
You’ll find that there are plenty of antioxidants in honey, which can help keep your brain in tip-top shape.<br>
In fact, research shows that honey may help postmenopausal women’s memory stay sharp by simply taking one spoonful each day.<br>
Adding a teaspoon to a cup of tea each day is an easy and refreshing way to meet that quota.<br>
Honey also helps the brain absorb calcium, which helps with memory as well.<br>
Taking good care of your brain via consuming proper nutrition can decrease your chances of contending with dementia down the road.<br>
 <br>
Cough Suppressant<br>
 
With the common cold being so prevalent, especially during winter months, it’s a great idea to have honey handy as it helps reduce a cough.<br><br
Sure, you can take over-the-counter cough syrups, but are you willing to ingest ingredients that are harsh on your immune system?<br>
Not every ingredient in cough syrup screams health for your body, but honey is an old-fashioned cough remedy that is jam-packed with health benefits.<br>
The honey coats the throat and keeps it calm by soothing the nerve endings that protect the throat.<br>
<br>Some doctors believe that two tablespoons of honey are just as effective as cough suppressants.<br>
<br>In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) gives credence to honey as a demulcent (something that relieves irritation or inflammation), which helps alleviate a cough due to the honey acting as a protective film over the throat.<br>
<br><br>Here is a great recipe for a honey lemon cough syrup that will surely help you out should you acquire a cough:<br>
Honey Lemon Cough Syrup<br><br>
You’ll need one lemon and some raw, unprocessed honey.<br>
Look for such at a farmer’s market, co-op, or natural health food store in your locality.<br>
Lemons are great at killing bacteria and, along with honey, soothing your throat.<br>
To make this cough syrup, simply get a small pan out and heat a pint of raw honey at a low heat level.<br>
Do not overheat honey, as this will alter its medicinal properties.<br>
Afterwards, get a second pan and boil the whole lemon for a few minutes.<br>
This will kill bacteria that may be on the lemon skin and soften the lemon.<br>
Once the lemon cools, slice it and add it to the warm honey on the stove.<br>
Simmer this concoction for one hour and then strain the lemon pieces from the honey mixture.<br>
Cool the honey, put it in a bottle, and refrigerate.
